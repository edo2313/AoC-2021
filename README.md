# AoC-2021

#### This is my submission for [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021)
I am using Javascript because yes.
Everything is run locally using Nodejs so I can take advantage of the *fs* module to read the input.txt files.

**Note that, while I tried my best to make the programs fast and efficient using built in functions and making sure I don't create billions of useless objects, the programs can be optimized and probably there are better ways to do some things.**

If you notice some, feel free to open an issue or do a pull request, explaining how and why I should improve my code, and I'll be pleased to review your alternative solution so I can improve myself.
Thanks!
